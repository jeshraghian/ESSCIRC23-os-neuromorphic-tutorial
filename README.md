# ESSCIRC/ESSDIRC 2023: Open-Source Neuromorphic Circuit Design Tutorial

This repository contains the notebooks related to hardware-aware training of spiking neural networks presented at ESSCIRC/ESSDIRC 2023 (Lisbon, Portugal) for the tutorial on *Open-Source Neuromorphic Circuit Design* co-presented by Charlotte Frenkel, Jason Eshraghian, and Rajit Manohar.

There are two notebooks in this repo:

* One for hardware-aware training spiking neural networks using [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch)
* One for running several neuromorphic designs through the OpenLane flow using the Sky130 PDK
